Validations Challenges

# Create a Rails application called company_contacts. The app will have a PostgreSQL database

$ rails new company_contacts -d postgresql -T

# Generate a model called Account that has a username, a password, and an email.

$ rails generate model Account username:string password:integer email:string
$ rails db:migrate 

All stories should have accompanying model specs.

DONE!
